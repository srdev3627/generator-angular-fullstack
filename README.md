### Install & run the generator.

Install Yeoman, generator-angular-fullstack, & the Gulp CLI

Make a new folder for your project, scope into it, and run the generator.

$ yo angular-fullstack
...
```

Answer the generator's questions to scaffold an app tailored to your preferences.

### Get up and running
