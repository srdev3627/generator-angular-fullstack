## Installation

Run `yo angular-fullstack` (optionally passing an app name):
```bash
yo angular-fullstack
```

You'll then be asked a series of questions regarding options for the generated app. Such things include using JavaScript or TypeScript,
HTML or Pug, Bootstrap, SQL, and so on. If you don't know what to answer for a question, or just want to use our preferred options,
hitting `ENTER` will use the default options for that question, and move on to the next one.

Once you've answered all the questions, a project will be scaffolded for you according to the options you entered. Then, npm dependencies
will automatically be installed. Once that's all complete, you're ready to get started with your app!
