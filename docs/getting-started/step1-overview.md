# Project Overview

Now that you've got a Full-Stack Angular project scaffolded, lets go over how everything is structured.

The first thing you should notice at the root of where you ran the generator is a `README.md` file.
Go ahead and listen to the angry filename and read it, then come back here.

You should have everything you need installed now. Find the `package.json` file.
That file tells npm which dependencies to install, as well as a few other things about your app.

Now find the `gulpfile.babel.js`. Pretty much everthing you do with your app from now on will have something to do with this file.
[Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) is a task runner that runs on top of Node. It automates tasks such as compiling code, copying files,
running different test commands, running your server, building your code for distribution, and on and on.
Let's go over some of the most important Gulp tasks:

* `serve` - 
* `build` - 
* `test` -
